# Combiners

## Blend

Blend node regroups all combiners into one node. The Blend node GUI lets you choose what kind of combining you want to do.

Possibilities are:
- Add (adds inputs)
- Sub (substracts the first input with the second input)
- Mul (multiplies inputs)
- Max (returns the greatest input)
- Min (returns the lowest input)

At the same time, Blend node lets you choose the weight of each input. 
Move the slider to the left to give more weight to the first input.
Move the slider to the right to give more weight to the second input.
